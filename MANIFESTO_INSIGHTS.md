## 🧠 CORE PHILOSOPHY

Poker is fundamentally a game of **human psychology under high pressure** rather than just cards or math. When stakes are real, players reveal their true selves through predictable psychological patterns that can be learned and exploited. Understanding these archetypes and the interplay between psychological needs and strategic goals gives you an edge to read, predict, and outmaneuver opponents. Mastering this system not only improves your poker but also sharpens your ability to navigate human behavior in life and business.

## 🎭 ARCHETYPES MENTIONED

### The Wizard (Integration Master)
- **Strength:** Sees everything at once - cards, psychology, intentions, fears
- **Wound:** Never fitting in anywhere (too logical for feeling people, too intuitive for math people)
- **How they destroy you:** Read your intentions before you act, plan 3 moves ahead
- **How to beat them:** Keep it simple, play straightforward poker, force them to beat you with cards not psychology

### The King (Natural Authority)
- **Strength:** Commands respect through quiet confidence earned under fire
- **Wound:** Deep fear of appearing weak, would rather lose money than lose face
- **How they destroy you:** You fold good hands assuming they're always strong
- **How to beat them:** Challenge their authority directly, make them prove hand strength, exploit ego when threatened
