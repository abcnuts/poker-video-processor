## 🧠 CORE PHILOSOPHY

The main strategy is to recognize that **limping from tight players, especially early in the hand, is often a disguised sign of strength rather than weakness**. This limp usually signals a premium hand setting a trap with the intention to raise later. 

Adjust your play accordingly by exercising caution and avoiding speculative calls when these warning signs appear, except in specific positional spots like the button where controlled limp-raises can be justified.
